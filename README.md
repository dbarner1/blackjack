<h1>Javascript BlackJack</h1>

<p>While one of the most basic games to play, I built this to display basic Javascript understanding, sans frameworks.  Function declarations, variables, call-backs, manipulation of HTML elements, and event control.</p>

<h2>How It's Made</h2>

<b>Tech used:</b> Vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS

Site employees several Javascript components (which is a snapshot of my learning mid-November 2016):

<ol><li>Function declaration</li>
<li>Call backs</li>
<li>Variable setting</li>
<li>Scope control</li>
<li>DOM manipulation</li>
<li>Event listener</li>
<li>Conditional events</li>
<li>Other - see code</li>
</ol>

<h2>Optimizations</h2>

The app was originally designed to ask the user's move using prompt alerts.  Since no one likes prompt alerts, I optimized it to use buttons, which were very flexible to show and hide, via conditional logic. 

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<ol>
<li>Felt "at home" with Javascript</li>
<li>Creating DRY code is very important.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Other Examples</h2>
